> HarvardX's CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science - FINAL PROJECT: New Tab Extension for Google Chrome

> This is my final project I created for the online CS50 class offered by Harvard through the [EdX website](https://www.edx.org/). This extension features: greeting the user (by name, once added in settings), a persistent To-Do list, a weather widget, a music player, external links, and a Google or a DuckDuckGo internet search. This project uses the Starter Template from Bootstrap 5.0.
